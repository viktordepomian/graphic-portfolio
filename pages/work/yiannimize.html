                        Yiannimize Competitions is an extension of the renowned
                        Yiannimize brand, offering users a chance to win
                        exclusive prizes they could only dream of. The existing
                        website faced usability and performance issues,
                        resulting in a subpar user experience. The objective of
                        this project was to redesign the website with a focus on
                        enhancing user experience, improving performance, and
                        increasing customer engagement.<i
