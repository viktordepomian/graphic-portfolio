                    <p>
                        Foodsteps is an innovative platform designed to measure
                        and reduce the environmental footprint of food from its
                        production to consumption. The core objective of the
                        project was to create an all-in-one platform that
                        empowers individuals and businesses to make informed
                        choices about their food consumption and its impact on
                        the environment.<i

                        <p>
                            To kickstart the project, extensive user research
                            was conducted, including surveys, interviews, and
                            market analysis. The research identified two primary
                            user personas:

                                a 30-year-old environmental enthusiast who is
                                passionate about sustainability and reducing her
                                ecological impact. She regularly shops for
                                organic and ethically sourced food, but she
                                lacks an easy way to track the carbon footprint
                                of her purchases.

                                customers. He seeks a reliable platform to track
                                the environmental impact of his restaurant's
                                menu items and make data-driven decisions to
                                reduce its carbon footprint.

                                <b>Data Integration and Accuracy:</b>
                                One of the significant challenges was sourcing
                                accurate and up-to-date data on the carbon
                                footprint of various food products. Different
                                sources provided conflicting information,
                                requiring a careful selection process to ensure
                                reliable data representation. To tackle data
                                accuracy challenges, we collaborated with
                                reputable environmental organizations and farms
                                to obtain reliable data. We also allowed users
                                to suggest updates, fostering a collaborative
                                community for data verification.

                                Creating a user-friendly interface that
                                effectively communicated the complex data on
                                carbon footprints and impact hotspots was
                                demanding. We had to strike a balance between
                                presenting detailed information and maintaining
                                an intuitive user experience for both Sarah and
                                David. We focused on Sarah and David's pain
                                points and expectations while designing the
                                interface. User testing and feedback were
                                continuously integrated to refine the design and
                                ensure an enjoyable experience for all users.

                                With a vast amount of data to process and
                                present, optimizing platform performance on
                                different devices was crucial. Ensuring smooth
                                user interactions across various screen sizes
                                and internet speeds required rigorous testing
                                and optimization. We opted for a PWA approach to
                                optimize performance and enable offline access.
                                This decision significantly improved platform
                                accessibility, especially for users with limited
                                internet connectivity.

                        <p class="margin-top">
                            Foodsteps also formed partnerships with several
                            renowned sustainability-driven restaurants,
                            resulting in a 37% reduction in their overall carbon
                            footprint within the first year of implementation.
