                    <p>
                        Purfectly Fresh is a UK-based cat food company that
                        offers personalized, fresh, and real meat-based cat food
                        tailored to each cat's unique nutritional and biological
                        needs. The company's mission is to provide healthy and
                        wholesome food for cats, challenging the existing
                        commercial cat food brands that often prioritize profits
                        over feline well-being. This project aimed to revamp
                        Purfectly Fresh's website and user experience to improve
                        customer engagement, increase new customer acquisition,
                        and enhance user satisfaction.<i

                            To start the project, extensive research was
                            conducted to understand the target audience,
                            competitors, and industry best practices. The team
                            also collected data on customer preferences, pain
                            points, and their experiences with existing cat food
                            brands.

                                Designing a platform that efficiently generates
                                personalized cat food plans based on each cat's
                                unique needs was challenging.
                                <b>Solution:</b> The team implemented an
                                AI-driven questionnaire that users would fill
                                out, providing essential details about their
                                cat's age, breed, weight, activity level, and
                                health conditions. The platform then utilized
                                this data to generate a tailored meal plan for
                                each cat.

                                food plans in an engaging and understandable way
                                was difficult. <b>Solution:</b> The team created
                                a set of playful illustrations that represented
                                various cat breeds and health attributes. These
                                illustrations were integrated into the AI-driven
                                questionnaire and meal plan sections to visually
                                communicate the personalization process.

                                devices and screen sizes was a crucial aspect of
                                the project. <b>Solution:</b> The team used
                                Figma to plan and prototype the responsive
                                design, meticulously testing and optimizing the
                                user flow for desktop, mobile, and tablet users.
                                The website was built using a mobile-first
                                approach to guarantee a smooth experience on
                                smaller screens.
